# Python Learning Collection

**Repository:** Prateek’s self-paced journey into Python programming

---

##  Overview

This repository contains a series of **Python scripts and exercises** that I’ve been working on from scratch. It’s a personal learning archive where I explore fundamental concepts, experiment with code, and deepen my understanding of programming.

##  Contents

Here are some of the key files and what they represent:

- `python.py`, `practice.py`, `lecture_two.py`, `lecture_three.py`, etc.  
  - Exercises and code samples from lectures and practice sessions.
- `just_fun.py`  
  - Fun, exploratory scripts—playground for testing Python ideas.
- `file_handling.py`  
  - Examples of reading from and writing to files in Python.
- `AI_chess.py`  
  - Early experiment with AI-powered chess logic built as I explored basic algorithms or game development concepts.
- (Add or update file descriptions as you go!)

##  Learning Goals

- Understand Python basics: data types, control flow, functions
- Practice file I/O, simple games, logic implementation
- Document incremental progress in coding skills
- Create a public, transparent learning log to reflect on as I grow
